<h1> 👋🏾 Hi, I’m Lauren a software developer 👩🏾‍💻 from Memphis,TN.</h1>
<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> Hey ya'll! I am software developer who is transitioning from healthcare to tech. While working through the pandemic, I realized that I could no longer mentally or physically be a respiratory therapist. After coming to that relization I decided to take some time off to figure out what I wanted to do next. On my career break I started studying to become a software developer. So far I am totally enamored with software development and being able to see my code turn into funcitonal projects.</p>
<h2>Languages:</h2>
<b>HTML, CSS, Javascript, React </b>
