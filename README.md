<h1> 👋🏾 Hi, I’m Lauren a software developer 👩🏾‍💻.</h1>
<h2> About Me: </h2>
   <p>
             With over seven years of experience as a respiratory therapist, I’ve had the privilege of working on the front lines of healthcare, delivering critical care and support to patients. This journey has honed my ability to remain calm under pressure, solve complex problems, and work collaboratively with a diverse team of professionals.</p>
			
 <p>Today, I’ve transitioned these skills into the tech world as a full stack software developer. I’m passionate about creating seamless, user-friendly applications and leveraging technology to improve lives. My unique background allows me to bring a fresh perspective to development, combining technical expertise with a deep understanding of patient and user needs.</p>

<p>I enjoy staying active, learning new technologies, and exploring innovative solutions that bridge the gap between healthcare and technology. Outside of coding, I love traveling to explore new cultures, spending time in nature and making new memories with my family and friends.</p>

<h2>Things I Know!</h2>
